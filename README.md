# Lawrge 2023: 3d Mirror Symmetry and 3d TQFT

2d mirror symmetry (or simply "mirror symmetry"), originating in the physics of two-dimensional supersymmetric QFT, has led to some of the most significant developments in algebra and geometry in the past two decades. 3d mirror symmetry is its deep but enigmatic older sibling -- a duality of three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories whose mathematical structure is under rapid current development. It is related to such diverse constructions as symplectic duality, Coulomb branches, elliptic stable envelopes, quantum K-theory, and perverse schobers. The goal of this workshop is to tie these mathematical developments together through the lens of 3-dimensional topological quantum field theory.
